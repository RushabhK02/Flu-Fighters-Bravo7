# Game Idea:
An endless runner concept where the objective of the game is to stay alive as long as possible while collecting points and avoiding different obstacles efficiently to have a high score. The player can jump and move sideways (left and right). The purpose of the game is to be fun and achieve a high score among friends. The player can switch between different modes to earn points faster. The theme of the game is to make the gloomy real world pandemic a bit more cheerful amidst the lockdowns and online classes. The game difficulty increases after the score crosses certain thresholds to spawn newer obstacles and power-ups as the player moves further in the game.
